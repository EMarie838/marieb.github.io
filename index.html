                             I would love constrcutive critcism/feedback on literally anything so just sit here, read, enjoy and marvel in the fact that I am actually somewhat smart to even have built this and all the cute layouts.
                             The sections down below is a bit about my personal life, and what made me want to do all this in the first place. I need to fill this page up with something so yh...enjoy! xx thank you again. </p>

        <p>
        I started off doing 4 A-level's physics, maths, computer science and economics. These subjects weren't female dominated especially computer science. One day this guy, (one the smartest guys in my school and had a big ego no one liked him like that) who I knew throughout secondary into sixthform, came to me in the maths corridor I believe he said "I am going to give it one month until you drop maths, physics and computing." When I tell you my jaw dropped - I was just so stunned like it's actually first thing in the morning no hello or nothing.
        My other good friend ( number 1 smartest of our year group) replied to the him and said "what's wrong with you" and tried to tell me to ignore him but it was too late, his words did actually affect me and my confidence, gave me imposture syndrome. 
        It brought me back to the mindset of I am a woman, I am black (I was the only black female in my maths class and only female in my computing class) this is not really the field for someone like me.
        It made me feel I was almost begging it and all of a sudden within that same month I think three weeks later I dropped computing, maths and physics I continued economics, but picked up english and sociology A-Level. I regretted it so much because I had a genuine love for the topics.
        I am bad at maths but I loved it, not sure how that makes sense but I guess because my self-esteem about the subject just dropped after that one sentence the guy told me, everything crumbled my grades literally everything. But I continued in my new A-level topics and pushed myself up until here being in uni. Basically, me doing coding etc...is me finishing off what I started. </p> 
        
        <p>I always knew I wanted to do this. I've grown up watching my dad and two brothers, one who studied maths and physics, the other who did computing and my dad who did both bascially. My dad, before retiring, would fix TV's, cars and computers and I would often watch all of them really just amazed and would tell myself whatever they learnt to do I will do but I will be better. I am the youngest in my family so I always felt there was this competition to prove I am literally the best and I most intelligent. 
        I did not want to be atheletic, even though it was always pushed on me it wasn't my dream but the dream of other people that I was carrying that kind of saw me going down this path as a get-rich-quick scheme. I did not want to fall in line and go into the casual female fields like healthcare, nursing or midwifery - NOTHING AGAINST IT JUST NOT WHAT I WANETD TO DO - please don't come for me. 
        I want to do something that left me empowered and my brain feel like a supercomputer and something that no matter the weather would consistently spark my curiosity and that was coding and data.
        This whole webiste is just me building that love and showing you, the reader, this is the product of my love. </p>
        
                    
        <p>English gcse's, we all learnt about Benjamin Zephaniah and Christina Rossetti. If you didn't let me begin by saying your school is crap, and you don't have a gcse in english and know life until you have studied the pair of them. I still continued learning about Zephaniah, Rossetti and the new one (Warsan Shire) when I did English A-level. Only two of these poems: 'No problem' and 'Home' connect, in your own time if you wish to read the poem, they both explore the issues of immigration, racism, the conflict of identity and belonging. 
        Rossetti is just unique that poem is based on the duchess of France in the 17th Century. But that poem, LORD, anyone in my English A-Level class would tell you me and this poem was like bread and butter!
        We could be studying a whole new poem talking about sunshine and rainbows somehow, I would manage to talk about this poem telling my teacher: "this poem kind of juxatposes Soeur Louise De La Misericorde' and my class mates would just laugh at my creativity to find a way to combine two poems that literally had nothing to do with each other. 
        One thing I wish I knew about this poem that I know now is that the repition of 'vanity of vanities' relates to King Solomon's book Ecclesiastes: "vanity of vanities," says the Preacher;" [Ecclesiastes 1:2] the whole book is about how life if futile without God being truly present and doing His will, wihtout Him life is like you trying to catch the wind. I swear if I put this in my A-Level exam I would'be gotten serious marks. Anyways, it isn't an english lesson if you want one hit me up x. </p>
        
                   
        <p> My point is, all three poems connect for me and I have carried and spoken each of them to myself. I am going to try and explain how, in my head it all makes sense not too sure about when I write it lol. Hopefully you notice me embedding the different poems and their meanings into my life and reason for doing HTML.
        Trying to find my career essentially, I distanced myself away from home. Many of us grew up in broken homes, some worse than others but we still come from broken homes. I knew where I wanted to be and still do, to get there I literally saw home as the mouth of the shark, and I did not want to be there or have anything connected to my home disrupting my goals and the mental pictures I have of myself in the future. The smallest of things I leave home, if it is to study and create this webpage I go to the library (where I am write now as I write this). </p>
        
        <p>Anything to do with my future and my career I never do at home, when I go home its Airpods in I am listening to music that continues the drive I had in the library, or at work, or the big tall beautiful buidlings I saw and took pictures of, that are now on shuffle as my lock screen, to remind me of where I want to be and will be. 
        But everything does still feel futile "vanity of vanities" as Rossetti and King Solomon said. Working on this page and doing other stuff on the side to build my career I just think I could die to today; I cannot take this to my grave so it feels like everything I am doing is in vain and for the sake of vanity becuase I just want to be an inspiration to other young black females, have a succesful career, and be the best in my family and have that pride, when my family and myself have our annual sit down, and to have my dad and siblings say something like "Marie you are so smart" or "Marie you really proved yourself to be the best out of all of us" but what does it all mean if I die successful and do not have a relationship with God. 
        So quick reminder to just be right with God, do His will, have the assurance of your salvation so life doesn't appear futile. </p>
